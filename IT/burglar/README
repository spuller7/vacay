Build inst-nounits to read from the current sensor with something like:
gcc -o inst-nounits inst-nounits.c -lphidget22

This gets called from the nodejs program b.js so you need it! You'll need to get the node modules for node-xmpp in order to use b.js and also the sendmail command needs to work (or you can rewrite it to use nodemailer) so good luck with that.

Then install b.js in your crontab with something like this:
* * * * * (cd /root/workspace/burglar; . /root/.bashrc; node b.js 2>/dev/null)
30 8 * * * (rm /root/workspace/burglar/amps.json)
